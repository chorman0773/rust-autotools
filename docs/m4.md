## LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC

File: `m4/lcrust_prog_rustc.m4`

Syntax: `LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC`

Detects the rust compiler and rust flags to use when building rust code for the host system, and tests to make sure it works properly. 
Requires invoking `AC_PROG_CC` and `AC_CANONICAL_HOST`. 

The variables `RUSTC` and `RUSTFLAGS` (marked as precious), are set to the rust compiler and rust flags to use to compile code for the host system, and are substituted in output files. If `--host` is explicitly specified, then also sets `rustc_host_target` to the target passed to rustc in `RUSTFLAGS`.

## LCRUST_RUSTC_VERSION

File: `m4/lcrust_prog_rustc.m4`

Syntax: `LCRUST_RUSTC_VERSION`

Determines the version and name of the rust compiler to be when building rust code for the host system. 
Requires invoking `LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC`

The variable `rustc_name` is set to the name of the rust compiler, as reported by `${RUSTC} --version`. The variable `rust_version` is set to the full version of the rust compiler reported by `--version`, `rust_major`, `rust_minor`, `rust_patch` and `rust_channel` are set to the major, minor, and patch versions, and the channel. `rustc_is_lccc` is set to `yes` if the rust compiler is `lccc`. All variables other than `rustc_is_lccc` is substituted in output files. 

## LCRUST_TRY_COMPILE

File: `m4/lcrust_prog_rustc.m4`

Syntax: `LCRUST_TRY_COMPILE(rust-src,[action-if-success],[action-if-failure])`

If `rust-src` can be compiled by `$RUSTC` as an rlib crate named test, then sets `try_compile_result=yes` and evaluates `action-if-success`, and otherwise sets `try_compile_result=no` and evaluates `action-if-failure`.
Require invoking `LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC`

## LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC_FOR_BUILD

File: `m4/lcrust_prog_rustc.m4`

Syntax: `LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC_FOR_BUILD`

Same as `LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC`, but sets `RUSTC_FOR_BUILD` and `RUSTFLAGS_FOR_BUILD` to the compiler and flags used to compile rust code for the build system instead of `RUSTC` or `RUSTFLAGS` respectively. If `--build` is explicitly specified, then also sets `rustc_build_target` to the target passed to rustc in `RUSTFLAGS_FOR_BUILD`.

This macro is useful for compiling proc-macro crates that will then be used later in the build process. 
It can be dangerous if the build compiler is not the same as the host compiler (other than being different builds of the same version of a cross-compilation unaware compiler, such as gccrs). 
Many rust compilers present an unstable abi, especially to proc-macros. Thus, using different compilers for host and build should rarely be done. 

## LCRUST_RUSTC_VERSION_FOR_BUILD

File: `m4/lcrust_prog_rustc.m4`

Syntax: `LCRUST_RUSTC_VERSION_FOR_BUILD`

Same as `LCRUST_RUSTC_VERSION` but uses `RUSTC_FOR_BUILD` instead, and each output is prefixed with `build_`.  Requires `LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC_FOR_BUILD`.


## LCRUST_TRY_COMPILE_FOR_BUILD

File: `m4/lcrust_prog_rustc.m4`

Syntax: `LCRUST_TRY_COMPILE_FOR_BUILD(rust-src,[action-if-success],[action-if-failure])`

Same as `LCRUST_TRY_COMPILE`, but uses `RUSTC_FOR_BUILD` and `RUSTFLAGS_FOR_BUILD` instead of `RUSTC` and `RUSTFLAGS`. Requires `LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC_FOR_BUILD`.


## LCRUST_CHECK_EDITION

File: `m4/lcrust_checks.m4`

Syntax: `LCRUST_CHECK_EDITION(edition,[action-if-failure])`

If `RUSTC` accepts `--edition $edition`, then sets `rust_edition` to `edition` and appends `--edition $edition` to `RUSTFLAGS`. Otherwise, sets `rust_edition` to `no` and evaluates `action-if-failure`. Requires `LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC`. 

## LCRUST_CHECK_FEATURE

File: `m4/lcrust_checks.m4`

Syntax: `LCRUST_CHECK_FEATURE(feature,[action-if-failure])`

If `RUSTC` accepts compiling with a rust feature named `feature`, then sets `rust_feature_$feature` to `yes` and adds `--cfg feature_$feature` to `RUSTFLAGS`. Otherwise, sets `rust_feature_$feature` to `no` and evaluates `action-if-failure`. Requires `LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC`.
his can be used to provide finer-grain control then `LCRUST_RUSTC_VERSION`

## LCRUST_TRY_COMPILE_WITH_FEATURE

File: `m4/lcrust_checks.m4`

Syntax: `LCRUST_TRY_COMPILE_WITH_FEATURE(rust-src,features,[action-if-success],[action-if-failure])`

If `rust-src` can be compiled by `$RUSTC` as an rlib crate, then sets `try_compile_result=yes` and evaluates `action-if-success`, otherwise, if `rust-src`can be compiled while using `#![feature($feature)]` for some `feature` in `features`, then sets `try_compile_result=$feature` and evaluates `action-if-success`. Otherwise, sets `try_compile_result=no` and evaluates `action-if-failure`.
Require invoking `LCRUST_PROG_RUSTC`
